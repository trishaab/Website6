            <h2>General Information about this webiste</h2>
        
        <img src="about us.images/wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe" class="image2">
        <p>The main theme of this site is to do with music. I choose this topic as music is one of my favourite things and I thought it would be cool to portray this on my website. When dealing with the colour theme I tried to stay within a certain range of colours. These shades came from light browns (specifically beige) and from dark greys. As I was unable to make a working search bar on my website, but wanted to be able to portray the idea, I added a fake search bar at the top of my website. My website is divided into three parts, the header, body and footer. The header is compiled with my logo, website name and navigation bar. The main section of my website includes the search bar, images, text and my table (on some pages). Finally the footer is divided from the main by a light grey strip (I got inspiration for this from the officeworks website). The footer includes another navigation bar which is usually used for any queries or help that a customer needs when dealing with a website. These links do not lead to another page, but if there was more time and more detail in the website these links could lead to things such as help pages or phone numbers. There is a diagram of my wireframe on the right. The drawings done in led pencil were my initial plans. The red adjustments were how I ended up creating the website. These changes in the website were made either because I was unable to code the idea or because I believed it looked better with/without the idea. (hover over the image to see the wireframe more carefully) </p>

        <li>I believe that my entire website is pretty consistent with both the format and the colour scheme</li>
        <li>The logo for my website is an original drawing that I made using canva </li>
        <li>When styling the table in css, I used code from the internet and experimented with it to make it look the way I wanted it to look which led to me making up some of my code</li>
        <li>Some of my images (the first image, other than the logo, on each page) change when the cursor hovers over them (this is an effort made to make the site responsive)</li>
        <li>I have made one css page called ‘mainstyle.css’ and attached this to every page (other than the homepage). This css page allows the appearance of all of the pages to be the same. Each other page has its own css styling page to adjust the size of images.</li>
