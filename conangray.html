            <h2>Who is Conan Gray?</h2>
        
        <img src="conan images/image1.jpg" alt="conan" class="image2">
        <p>Conan Gray is a singer and YouTuber who was born on December 5th, 1998 in San Diego, California. Conan's grandfather was afflicted with cancer at the age of one and a half, so his family relocated to Hiroshima, Japan, to care for him. Conan and his family returned to California soon after his grandfather passed away. His parents eventually got separated, compounding the bad luck. He and his mother's family relocated to Texas while he was in sixth grade. On January 20th, 2013, he launched what was then known as ConanxCanon there. In addition to making films about his art portfolios, high school and college advise, Babble & Bake, Art-Tea, music covers, original songs, music videos, thrift store apparel hauls, and much more, he previously attended UCLA. He also has a YouTube channel. On November 20th, 2014, he made his debut YouTube rendition of Bob Dylan's "Make You Feel My Love." His songs frequently have a depressing tone since many of them are inspired by experiences he has had himself or that of close friends and family. On November 16, 2018, Republic Records released his debut EP, Sunset Season. It includes two more tracks, "Greek God" and "Lookalike," in addition to the previously released singles "Idle Town," "Generation Why," and "Crush Culture." Kid Krow, Conan's debut album, was made available on March 20, 2020. The singles "Checkmate," "Comfort Crowd," "Maniac," "The Story," and "Wish You Were Sober" were all part of it. Superache, Conan Gray's sophomore album, was made available on June 24, 2022 through Republic Records. Along with five additional tracks, it contains five singles, including "Astronomy," "People Watching," "Jigsaw," "Memories," and "Yours."</p>

       Taylor Swift has been identified by Gray as his greatest inspiration, and he claims to be "the largest Swiftie" and to have "been nurtured by [her]". He told People, "I love her so much. I love her music. I love what she does. I love her lyricism. I love how she's handled her career. She's just such a boss. I grew up listening to her music since I was nine years old. I feel like she shaped me so much as a person." On her personal Instagram account, Swift praised Gray's first album Kid Krow and the song "Wish You Were Sober," to which Gray replied,"Thank you for being my lifelong songwriting inspiration and icon. I honestly feel like you raised me both as a writer and a human and I cannot express in words how much the means to me. Thank you for everything. Swiftie for life". Gray said that Swift is his favourite artist in an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music "number one above all," he said, adding, "I'll never understand how she does what she does; she's simply my songwriting idol. She truly is great ". Gray also disclosed that Swift had praised Kid Krow in a message to him. The small-town nostalgia of Lorde's debut album Pure Heroine had a key influence on Gray's EP Sunset Season, which he recognised as one of his other major influences. Along with naming The Chicks and Adele as among of his musical influences, he has also expressed respect for Billie Eilish and V of BTS. Talking about Eilish's rapid rise to fame in 2019, Gray told ET: "Billie and I have been friends since, like, literally forever, since she was, like, 15. I was like, 17. We were really young. Watching her have to figure out all these little things along the way has been really helpful for me."
