            <h2>Who was Juice WRLD?</h2>
        
        <img src="juice images/image2.jpg" alt="juice" class="image2">
        <p>Juice Wrld, pronounced "juice world," was the stage name of Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 â€“ December 8, 2019), an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He was a key player in the emo rap and SoundCloud rap scenes that attracted recognition from the general public in the middle to late 2010s. He explained that his stage moniker, which was inspired by the 1992 movie Juice, stands for "taking over the world." Higgins began his independent music career in 2015 and, in 2017, he agreed to a recording deal with Grade A Productions and Interscope Records. His 2018 single "Lucid Dreams," which is now diamond-certified and climbed at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, helped him become well-known. It was included on his 2018 triple platinum first studio album Goodbye & Good Riddance, which also featured the Hot 100-charting songs "All Girls Are the Same," "Lean Upon Me," "Wasted," and "Armed and Dangerous." After working with Future on the mixtape Wrld on Drugs (2018), he followed it up with the 2019 release of his second album, Death Race for Love, which featured the smash song "Robbery" and marked Higgins' first number one debut on the US Billboard 200. On December 8, 2019, Higgins overdosed on drugs and passed away. The track "Come & Go" (with Marshmello) became Higgins' second song to reach number two on the Hot 100, and his first posthumous album, Legends Never Die (2020), matched chart records for most successful posthumous debut and most U.S. top-ten hits from one album. Fighting Demons, his second posthumous album, included the US top 20 hit "Already Dead," and it was released in 2021 at the same time as the documentary Juice Wrld: Into the Abyss.</p>

       Higgins was travelling on a private Gulfstream plane on December 8, 2019, from Los Angeles' Van Nuys Airport to Chicago's Midway International Airport. Federal agents had informed law enforcement while the plane was in flight that they believed there could be weapons and narcotics on board, and they were waiting for the aeroplane to arrive. Law enforcement officials later disclosed that they discovered 70 lb (32 kg) of marijuana on the plane and that several members of Higgins' management team who were travelling with him claimed that Higgins had taken "several unknown pills," including multiple Percocet pills, to conceal them while officers were on the plane searching the luggage. Following Higgins's onset of convulsions and seizures, two doses of the life-saving drug Narcan were given since it was thought that she may have overdosed on opioids. Higgins was brought to Oak Lawn's Advocate Christ Medical Center, where doctors there declared him dead. The Cook County Medical Examiner reported on January 22, 2020, that Higgins' death was caused by toxic quantities of oxycodone and codeine in his body. On December 13, 2019, Higgins' funeral was conducted at Harvey, Illinois' Holy Temple Cathedral Church of God in Christ. Ski Mask the Slump God and Young Thug, two of his collaborators, were among the friends and relatives that came. Higgins' mother stated that she hoped her son's legacy would aid those facing addiction, stating, "Addiction has no bounds, and its effects extend beyond the addict themselves. We are confident that Jarad's legacy of affection, joy, and emotional sincerity will endure ". Later, she created the Live Free 999 Fund in Higgins' name and in recognition of his struggle with addiction, anxiety, and despair. The fund's main objective is to assist initiatives that cater to underprivileged and youthful people. The group wants to mainstream the discussion of the mental health issues that Higgins experienced and provide individuals a method to deal with them in a healthy way. It focuses on addiction, anxiety, and despair.
